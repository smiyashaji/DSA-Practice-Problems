# DSA Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Solutions Repository**! This is an open-source collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, categorized and solved in multiple programming languages. We aim to provide a structured platform where anyone can contribute solutions to DSA problems.

If you believe that your solution is **more optimized** than the existing one in the repository, feel free to open a **Pull Request (PR)** with your improved version.

Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or expert in DSA, this repository is a great place to practice, contribute, and learn.

## Overview

This repository contains a large set of problems (450+) from popular platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **HackerRank**, etc., sorted into categories such as:

- Arrays
- Sorting
- Linked Lists
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- And more!

Each problem has:

- A **problem statement** (`problemStatement.md`)
- A solution in multiple languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Optional **test cases** for validating the solution

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from everyone! Here's how you can get involved:

- **Fork** this repository
- **Clone** it to your local machine
- Choose a problem or category
- **Add your solution** in your preferred language
- At the bottom of your solution file, please add **Time and Space Complexities** of your code in form of comments.
- Add relevant **test cases** to validate your solution (if applicable)
- **Commit** your changes and **push** them to your fork
- **Create a Pull Request (PR)** with a description of the changes and screenshot of passed test cases on any platform.

If you want to help improve the repository or have suggestions for new features, feel free to open an issue or contribute directly!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by categories and subfolders for each problem. Here's an example structure:

```
- 01-Array
  - 01-reverse-the-array
    - problemStatement.md   # Problem description
    - python
      - reverse_array.py     # Python solution
    - java
      - ReverseArray.java    # Java solution
    - cpp
      - reverse_array.cpp    # C++ solution
    - test_reverse_array.py  # Optional test cases (Python)
```

- Each category folder contains problems.
- Inside each problem folder:
  - `problemStatement.md` contains the problem description.
  - Language-specific folders (e.g., `python`, `java`, `cpp`) contain the respective solutions.
  - Optionally, there might be test files for validating solutions.

## Supported Languages

We encourage contributors to add solutions in any language of their choice! Some of the common languages are:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- C
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP

If you'd like to add a solution in another language, feel free to do so!

## How to Add Your Solution

To add a new solution:

1. Navigate to the appropriate category folder (e.g., `01-Array`).
2. Create a new folder for the problem (e.g., `01-reverse-the-array`).
3. Add the following:
   - **problemStatement.md**: The problem description (you can use the template provided).
   - **Solution file(s)**: Add your solution in the language of your choice.
4. Create a `test_` file if you wish to include test cases for the solution.
5. Once you're done, commit your changes and create a pull request.

### Example:

For the problem "Reverse an Array":

```
- 01-Array
  - 01-reverse-the-array
    - problemStatement.md
    - python
      - reverse_array.py
    - java
      - ReverseArray.java
    - cpp
      - reverse_array.cpp
```

## Test Your Solutions

We recommend that you test your solution thoroughly before submitting it. If your solution passes **all the test cases on the respective platform** (e.g., LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks), you can proceed with submitting it.

Once your solution passes the platform's test cases, **you are ready to submit**.
